<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">S</span>ex is messy. At the most basic level, individuals are engaged in a selfish struggle to reproduce and pass on their genetic material to the next generation. However, if different sexes have opposing reproductive tactics, natural selection can force individuals in opposite directions. For example, males may become forceful in their mating attempts, which exerts a cost on females, who in turn evolve to avoid coercive mating attempts. This conflict of reproductive interest is known as “sexual conflict” and is responsible for some of the dramatic reproductive strategies we see in nature (think huge curly duck penises). For our weekly journal club, we discussed a paper by <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2016.1796"> "Buechel et al."</a> just published in Proc. Royal Soc. B. which looked at the phenomenon of sexual conflict as a potential driver of antagonistic sexual selection.</p>

The study used mosquitofish in a laboratory experiment where males were artificially selected for either longer or shorter genitalia length, relative to a control line. The alarming mating system of the mosoquitofish made it a good candidate for studying sexual conflict. Males fertilise eggs inside the female body by sneaking up and forcing copulation using an elongated fin called a gonopodium. These encounters are typically very aggressive, with multiple males harassing females to the point of exhaustion. Males with longer gonopodia are assumed to have an advantage in these coercive mating events, with females experiencing increased harassment.

The authors employed a clever analogy comparing sexual conflict to predator-prey conflict, where each party is constantly evolving to outwit the other. In this evolutionary arms race the prey (or in this case the female) is expected to evolve a larger brain than the predator (or the male) to aid escape from aggressive advances. After nine generations of selecting for larger male genitalia, the female fish in these lines did indeed have heavier brains than those in lines selected for short genitalia. A neat result showing genetic correlation between male genitalia length and female brain size. However, there was no increase in relative size of brain sub-regions, such as those responsible for vison or spatial positioning. This made us question whether larger female brains actually did help to outsmart males. A lively discussion followed on the tendency for authors to sometimes oversell their study findings. A way to “sex” up a paper, as it were! We also came up with some good ideas of how to take this work further to address outstanding questions. The prize for best alternative title was awarded to “Large penises and female geniuses”. Overall, a fascinating paper which certainly peaked everyone’s interest.
