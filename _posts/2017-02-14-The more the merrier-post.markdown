<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>his week we read <a href="https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article-abstract/27/6/1820/2453487/Beneficial-effects-of-group-size-on-oxidative"> “Beneficial Effects of Group Size on Oxidative Balance in a Wild Cooperative Breeder”</a> recently published by Sophie Lardy et al. in Behavioral Ecology. The main result of the study was that both oxidative damage (measured with TBARS) and antioxidant activity (SOD) are reduced as the groups of Alpine marmot increase in size. The authors argue that larger group sizes are beneficial during hibernation, as more individuals increase social thermoregulation and alleviates the cost of hibernation.</p>

One wonders how flat a line must be before you stop seeing a positive or negative (in this case) association between two variables, but in the end we decided that if p < 0.05 you don’t need to worry about it and you just move on.

We were also a bit baffled by what seemed to be two contradictory predictions: a) oxidative damage decreases with group size, and b) oxidative damage increases with the number of same-sex subordinates in the group (one would think in larger groups you will have more of those buggers). In the end, we reasoned that the authors knew what they were doing and that possibly both predictions were a way of articulating an expectation for an optimal outcome at intermediate group sizes. We are just that accommodating, you see: if authors are not clear, we will fill in the gaps. 

So, anyway, if you happen to be an Alpine marmot and you are worried about your oxidative balance, make sure you have some relatives around, the more the merrier.
