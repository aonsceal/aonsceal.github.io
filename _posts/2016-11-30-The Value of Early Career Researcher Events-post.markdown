<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">A</span>lthough they can sometimes seem repetitive, and not worth taking time out of a main conference for, Early Career Researcher (ECR) events can be incredibly useful, but not always in the way you think. Not because you’re going to get THE answer on how to be a successful scientist, but because you realise that there are many ways of achieving success, each unique to the individual researcher. By broadening your horizons from your small research group or department you are exposed to the variety of ways in which people have established themselves as academics and handled the multiple challenges faced when starting your career.</p>

Every scientist’s background and experiences will be different, and this will greatly inform how they approach challenges and what the best course of action is for them. Even the writers of this blog have all come to our current positions from different routes and have different backgrounds. And each of us brings slightly different experiences to the community when we share them with others.

I’ve only recently returned to academia after a 5 year break working in ‘the real world’ (as my supervisor likes to call it). I was incredibly lucky with the jobs I had over those five years. I worked in science communication and got to meet some amazing, inspiring people, including the heads of NASA and CERN, Nobel Prize winners and key players in the climate negotiations. But eventually I realised that really I wanted to be doing and talking about my own research, rather than someone else’s. So I took the daunting step of packing in a nice, secure job in London and moving back to Ireland to pursue a PhD, and hopefully a successful career in science.

Which is how I found myself in an Edinburgh conference centre on a Tuesday afternoon in September, listening to a panel of mid-career seabird researchers discuss how to progress in science. And what I found far more useful than any generic ‘tips and tricks’ was hearing the routes they had taken to get to where they are today. Even talking to the other ECRs, particularly those that were a few years further on than me, was insightful. Mostly in reassuring me that I wasn’t the only one who had taken a few years out to go back to a PhD, and that baking is an essential therapy activity in any university department.

I believe that one of the key things to learn early on in your academic career is to talk to other researchers and share your experiences. Someone else’s solution to a challenge may not be exactly the right one for you but it might help you to consider other options you hadn’t thought of. And in a time when we’re increasingly been told <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/young-scientists-under-pressure-what-the-data-show-1.20871">there aren’t enough traditional academic jobs to go around</a>, making PhD students more aware of alternative paths can only be a good thing. 

Sharing experiences also makes you realise that you’re not as alone as you might think. Most ECRs (and all researchers) will go through the same challenges at some point, including conflict with supervisors; failed experiments; rejected papers; having a work-life balance; promoting your research; finding your first post-doc etc. There are tons of blog posts out there about how to deal with these challenges but actually hearing it from someone in the flesh can have much more of an impact.

So the next time you’re at a conference, take time out to go to whatever ECR event has been organised – it won’t be a waste of time. Just having a chance to engage with researchers at the same stage as you and realising you’re not alone can be hugely rewarding. And the drinking/socialising that follows is just a bonus!
