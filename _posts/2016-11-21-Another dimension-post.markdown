<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">O</span>ver the history of science, a number of high profile scientists have made the transition from physics to biology. This movement of minds has led to some of the biggest insights in biology from Erwin Schrödinger and Francis Crick on the nature of DNA to Bob May on population dynamics. The paper we focused on for our journal club this week seems to also have benefited from a physical viewpoint, this time in the form of Dr Van Savage who came equipped with a PhD in particle physics.</p>

<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v486/n7404/full/nature11131.html">‘Dimensionality of consumer search space drives trophic interaction strengths’</a> by Pawar and colleagues looked at differences in how consumers and their resources interact in 3 dimensions versus 2. The essence of the paper was captured very nicely by the main figure. If we consider a marine predator searching for its prey in the pelagic zone that would be considered a 3D interaction but if it was searching the benthos, then it’s 2D. It’s important to realise this isn’t restricted to carnivores, a terrestrial grazer is engaging in a 2D trophic interaction when it eats grass. 

The consequence of this difference is that a consumer will bump into resources more frequently in a 3D volume than in a 2D area. This finding has a series of implications for, among many others, the dynamics of populations and the coexistence of species. One particular highlight for me was the realisation that increased encounter rates in 3D may be the reason for the ability of gigantic consumers to subsist on tiny prey as is the case for baleen whales and plankton. 

The authors were able to back up their theoretical model with an impressive collection of consumption rates that provided strong support for their theory. We did have concerns that the abundance of equations in the paper would be a hindrance to researchers, something that has been shown to occur with <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/109/29/11735.abstract">mathematically dense papers</a>. That said, the excellent figures do a great job in getting the central point across. 

We agreed that this is exactly the sort of paper that belongs in Nature, a big idea, well supported by data with ramifications for many aspects of biology. You know the authors are onto something when we were able to come up with a range of ideas in the space of half an hour that could be tested in light of the result.
